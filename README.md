# Introduction

This project asks me to sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the smallest possible number of actions. To succeed, I need to manipulate different types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (from among several) for optimized data sorting.

At [42 School](https://github.com/42School), almost every project must be written in accordance to the [Norm](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf), the school's coding standard. As a result, the implementation of certain parts may appear strange and for sure had room for improvement.
